# AoC 2018 - Rust

Advent of code 2018 problems solved using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Installation and setup

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Running

Each file in `bin/` corresponds to a single AoC problem. Part 1 and part 2 of each problem
are implemented in separate folders. All programs take input from stdin and print the answer to stdout.

```sh
cargo run --bin day_01_p1 < input.txt
```

You can get the inputs from [AoC 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).
