# AoC 2015 - Python

Advent of code 2015 problems solved using [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation and setup

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- (Optional) Create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html)
- Install the project and its dependencies by running `pip install -e .` in this folder.

## Running

Each script in `src/` folder corresponds to a single AoC problem. Part 1 and part 2 of each problem
are implemented in separate files. All scripts take input from stdin and print the answer to stdout.

```sh
python src/day_01_p1.py < input.txt
```

You can get the inputs from [AoC 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).
