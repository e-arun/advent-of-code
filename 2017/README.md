# AoC 2017 - Go

Advent of code 2017 problems solved using [Go](https://go.dev/).

## Installation and setup

- Install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)

## Running

Each folder in `cmd/` corresponds to a single AoC problem. Part 1 and part 2 of each problem
are implemented in separate folders. All programs take input from stdin and print the answer to stdout.

```sh
go run cmd/day_01_p2/main.go < input.txt
```

You can get the inputs from [AoC 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017).
